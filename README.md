# Motor Test Bench

The motor test bench is a platform to measure rotational speed and torque of small DC motors.
These results are usefull for building the characteristic curve for those motors you have no information about.

The motor input voltage is controlled through PWM (pulse width modulation). 
At the same time, the bench can simultaneously measure torque, rotational speed and motor current.

An encoder disk is attached to the motor shaft. As the shaft rotates, an optical switch counts the pulses provided by that disk.
Rotational speed is then calculated dividing the number of turns by the time spent on those turns.

Torque is calculated by measuring the force applied to a load cell by a lever arm. Knowing the length of the lever arm, it's possible to calculate the motor torque.
That lever arm is coupled to the shaft only by the friction generated by a spring. The friction can be adjusted by tightening that spring.
